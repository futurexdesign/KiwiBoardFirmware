# KiwiBoardFirmware
Firmware for KiwiBoard upgrade to KiwiClean watch cleaning machine. 

Build is done via platform.io 

Using the aurdino-pico arduino core instead of the default mbed based version.   arudino-pico allows more flexability with the hardware.   

Windows user: Must enable long-path support to get the platform to install correctly: Ref: https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/platformio.html#important-steps-for-windows-users-before-installing  

If you are on windows 11 home, you will need to enable gpedit inorder to enable long path support (https://www.itechtics.com/enable-gpedit-msc-windows-11/)
